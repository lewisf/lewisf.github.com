Whenever my parents used to tell me stories about so-and-so kid doing something amazing, I used to think in my head - pshh, he got lucky that he even got the opportunity to do something amazing.

I don't remember exactly when I decided to cut the bullshit and start working harder at constantly trying to improve myself and putting myself outside my comfort zone, but I'm seeming to get luckier and luckier in terms of the opportunities I'm given. I'm at the point where I can't even decide whether or not I want to take an opportunity when before, I was on my knees begging for them. I don't know who first said the above quote, but even if science can't support it, there seems to be some sort of correlation between how hard people work at intentionally putting themselves outside their comfort zone and how many opportunities they're given.

Someone imparted me on some wisdom earlier this week - "The only thing we conquer in life is fear" - sounds like something out of Spiderman or something, but the more I think about it, the more I think it's true. When it comes down to whether or not we can do something, it's the fear that prevents us from actually trying. After we've started, it's the fear that prevents us from finishing. When we finish, its the fear we conquered that makes us feel that good.

Conquering fears is such a badass reason of getting things done, that looking at it this way is a great motivator to improve, improve, improve - just for the sake of improving. It makes me feel like I'm Bruce Wayne conquering his fear of bats before he finally succeeds and starts calling himself Batman.

I don't really know where I'm going with this - but I know that if I continue working hard and making sound decisions, I'll be in good shape no matter what happens. My life isn't the mess that it used to be anymore.

  because it's still relevant, and a good reminder to me of the feeling I had at the moment**
