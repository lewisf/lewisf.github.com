Unfortunately, my life's been a rollercoaster, and I haven't been
as productive as I would have liked to be for the past 9 weeks.
It's time to get back on track, and in trying to get into a fresh
start, I decided to revive this blog.

I decided to opt out of using octopress and going with jekyll bootstrap
w/ Tom Preston Warner's jekyll theme. It's cool how easy it was to setup
and how much cleaner this seems. Going to try to post more
regularly so I can document my academic/professional progress
throughout my life.
