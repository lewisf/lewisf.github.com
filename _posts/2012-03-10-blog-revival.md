Unfortunately, for the past few week's my life's been kind of crazy
due to the rush to figure out where I'm going to be this summer. It has
been hard trying to balance university homework and studies, side
projects I've promised to work on, and interviews/code challenges for
the interviews.

It is my failure, however, that I was unable to successfully deal with
all of this. I ended up dropping out of a course this quarter, because
I wasn't handling the load (I feel like in tip top shape, I could've
handled it), and I pretty much failed across the board in keeping up
with side projects.

In trying to put this all behind me, I decided to revive this blog
anew. Hopefully, this time around, I'll be posting more regular
updates about my academic and professional work.
