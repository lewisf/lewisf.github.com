In the last year and a half I've:
* found an unsatiable love for video games
* found an undeniable hate for video games
* found a love for watching basketball leisurely
* geeked out way too many times
* learned over 7 programming languages
* found an immense love for Ruby
* realized Python is cool too.
* learned 3+ web frameworks
* joined and left two startups
* worked on a project for display at the Rose Bowl
* worked on a project that brought reminders, alarms, and weather alerts to dumb phones
* worked on a supply sharing platform for non-profit organizations
* and worked countless other projects
* gotten excited about random entrepreneurial ideas way too many times
* discovered a love for dark beers
* drunk the first wine I have ever found to be enjoyable
* gone from being winded after 1 mile, to being able to run 13 miles straight.
* gotten as fit as I have ever been in my life (even though I still have a long ways to go)
* had an extended stay alone outside of California for the first time
* fallen in love with Europe
* become more of a positive-thinker than I have ever been
* locked in a full-time job post-graduation
* made my parents proud for the first time in what seemed like forever, and continued to do so
* and most importantly *made myself proud* for the first time in as long as I could remember

*Damn. It's insane what we can accomplish when we put our minds into it.*
