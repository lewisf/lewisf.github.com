Over the pass couple of months, I have gotten a lot better at time management
and would like to document a few tips that could be useful to any other college 
student.

* Realize that **college is not just a party**. Sure, have fun, but you're not paying
  big ass bucks in order to not figure out the rest of your life.
* **Prioritize sleeping**. It's very easy to give up sleeping - bad time management
  generally leads to needing to give up sleep in order to finish work, but
  life really sucks when you're sleep deprived.
* With that said, give up sleep if there is a good reason for it. Like if you're
  advancing your passion. In my case this consists of long nights programming.
* **Stop complaining about how hard life is**. Face the facts, you have classmates
  that aren't complaining. Instead working their asses off to ace the exams.
  If you have the time to complain, you aren't even trying to be competitive.
* Also realize you're not just competing with your classmates. You're competing
  with the hundreds of thousands college grads each year - and probably everyone
  in your field thats older than 20. Yeah, that's a shit ton of people.
* **Stop making things hard for yourself.** Bad decisions lead to bad consequences,
  and bad consequences lead to more time wasted. Make good decisions, you know
  a somethings a bad decision when you have to reassure yourself it's going to
  be okay.
* Hobbys are fine - if you are succeeding at life. If you're not, then you need
  to put those hobbys on the side for the time being and figure out what the hell
  you're doing.

College is a small part of life. Yes, enjoy it, but also realize that
college is one of the times in your life where you have resources everywhere to
explore your passions. __Don't waste the opportunity.__
