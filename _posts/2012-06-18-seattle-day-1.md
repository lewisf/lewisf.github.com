Seattle is **AMAZING**. Okay, from a kid who's lived in suburban areas all his life,
it might just be the intense craving for metropolitan living that's getting to me, but
SEATTLE IS AMAZING.

I flew into Seattle yesterday, and the first thing I did was request for a driver
using [Uber](www.uber.com), picked up my bags and low and behold, my driver Tek
was waiting for me outside in a black Ford Expedition SUV with leather seats, wow
all for me. The whole ride was very enjoyable; my driver Tek, talked to me about
life in general and gave me tips about what to do in Seattle, pointing out landmarks
on the way. All in all, the fare was $75, kinda pricey, but I had $10 of credit,
and the experience was 5 stars, would use again.

I landed in a university-esque apartment, so it wasn't anything amazing, but it
was nice and the subletters were really nice. I was surprised because I thought
I was going to be staying in a 2 bedroom apartment, and it ended up 3 bedroom, shared
with the original subletter, so meh, well shit happens.

Walking around University District, Seattle made me forget all of that. This place
is amazing ... the convenience of stores, the safety this city area instills in me,
the kindness of random strangers on the street helping me find my way, and the beauty
of University of Washington just a couple of blocks away. I've never been taken in
by warmer hands in a new location, I'm excited to continue my stay here.

With that said, my first day has just been a bunch of exploring. Completely stoked
to go to Downtown tomorrow to start work at Amazon. When that happens, much fun
will be had.
