Being a college student, I would consider it pretty natural for me to start seeking out
alternative paths to success when the main one gets less and less promising - in this case
my GPA is much lower than where I want it. Two things really contribute to this:

1. I wasn't really focused or motivated to actually succeed in high school and the beginning
of college. I was as they say, *all talk no action*. I could say I had dreams, but when it
came down to it, I didn't have the focus on any particular goal to achieve anything.
2. Now that I'm motivated to succeed, college courses doesn't fully align with my goals
and dreams. I know that the content I learn in college is useful, but being a computer scientist,
and with the current university curriculum, I could learn all of this in the future on my own
if I so choosed to. Everything is either online, or in a well-written handbook somewhere. Because
of this, I choose to weigh *extra-curriculars* and *university* at the same importance. Sadly,
this often leaves me with either sleep deprivation, or me not doing as well as I had hoped on
one or the other.

Why am I bringing this up?

Well, tonight marks the end of my hard finals for this quarter, and sorry to say the least, I
definitely did not do as well as I could have on these two finals, because of what I have to
get done at work - launching websites into production, debugging these sites, and constantly
monitoring it for errors. This past weekend, I spent approximately 30 hours of the 48 hours
working on our contract project, slept probably 10 of those remaining 18 hours, and spent the
last bunch of hours working on the final assignment due for UCSD's *CSE 130: Programming Languages
and Paradigms*. As a result I didn't have much time to study for finals, which negatively affected
my performance on them.

Yesterday, after my 7-10pm final, I headed to work where I continued to fix bugs and meet new
spec requirements from our contractors, and ended up returning home at 3:30am, and dozed off
until around 10am, a healthy 6 and a half hours, much needed after my previous night's 4 hours of
sleep following the 10 hour sleep weekend.

The above circumstances don't always happen, but I feel like job recruiters also understand
that some students have other obligations that often cause them to do university work at a sub-par
level because of the time deficiency, naturally resulting from extra-curricular commitments. What kills
me, is that if I didn't work alongside my university work, or even if the contract work deadline was
another week, I'm highly confident I could have easily got A's in all
my classes this quarter (I highly doubt it now), which is unfortunate, because that means that
university grades then don't accurately record my proficiency as a programmer.

Taking that into account, that many students may actually be way more proficient in programming and
computer science theory than their grades tend to reflect, then why is the importance of GPA so
highly emphasized? I mean, I guess different people find different values in a number printed on
a transcript, but how does it hold up to say, experience on the job, and previous projects or
work done?

What do I want my resume to look like in the future? Do I want to improve my GPA over the course of
the next 2 years, or do I want to get more field related experience?
