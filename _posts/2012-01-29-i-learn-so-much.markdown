Tonight I stumbled upon Zach Holman's (@holman) dotfiles after watching on of his
intriguing screencasts. His terminal prompt seemed so minimal yet functional, and
for me seeking ways to minimalize aspects of my life, it definitely piqued
my curiosity.

Luckily, his dotfiles were easy found on his Github page. Even better, it was the
MOST organized and MOST easy to adapt dotfiles I've ever looked at. I must say
that I am always impressed and inspired by reading out of Zach's Github repos ...

going to try to write code and software of the same quality as him.

So definitely the best additional is the branch status tracking built right
into the prompt. This will definitely come in handy.
