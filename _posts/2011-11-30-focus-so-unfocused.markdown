For the last year, I've been fervently learning ruby on rails, javascript, and other
various open source web technologies because as of a year ago, web programming was a completely
unexplored field for me, and every course offered at university taught outdated
web technologies. I pursued web because I found it very interesting, getting satisfying initial
results was quicker and easier than anything else I've ever worked on. I was happy and even considered almost
dropping out of school and picking up a full time career in web programming at a company I intered for
this past summer.

However, I've come to realize that there's a difference between putting together a simple rails
site, and Facebook. There are many scalability issues and technical problems that I need
to prepare myself, so in light of becoming a better programmer, I'm going to spend
the next few months reviewing the fundamentals of programming and algorithms.

So I've decided I'm finally going to really read through __The C Programming Language__ by 
Kernighan and Ritchie. I've had a digital copy of this book for like a year 
now, and everyone says its one of the books every programmer should read. we'll
see how it goes, maybe I'll write about interesting finds.

For the time being, __to the right is something I've been working on.__

A project that gave me a change to mess around with UX/UI design. Still
some work to do, but not too shabby.
