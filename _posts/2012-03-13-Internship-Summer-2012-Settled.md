It's currently the week before finals, and I just got good news that **I'll 
most likely be heading to Seattle in the summer** to gain experience in the 
field of my studies. Exciting! All that's left for me to do is go through
all the legal stuff and then no more worrying about having something to do this
summer.

**Compilation of tips given to me and things I've learned during the application process, hopefully this will
be useful to future summer internship applicants:**

1. **Don't get lazy, apply everywhere.** Start early and don't
stop applying until you've found a place.

2. **Go to career fairs.** Listen to what the people manning the booths talk
about and try to find an interest of yours relevant to theirs, so you can
hold an interesting conversation. If you don't score an interview, you'll learn a bit about their
company and perhaps find out how to better prepare yourself next time.


3. An often overlooked source of summer internships by undergrads are
startups. **Startups are a BIG source of internships** ... there are
A LOT of them who are looking for interns.
Apply for startup internships - it may be easier to find yourself
a fit. Also remember, winner's can't be choosers. It's much better
to have an internship over the summer with a small salary than no internship
at all. I went through a stage where I agreed to intern at a startup for
awhile, with minimal benefits, in order to get experience. That experience
pushed me on to try newer and greater things. It is the experience that matters
not the pay, especially when you're still in school.

4. *startupdigest.com* - A good resource for starting talks with startups.

5. Startups and bigger companies generally look for different things during
interviews. Most startups I talked to were looking for a good understanding
of the software tools, such as knowledge of javascript, jquery, ruby, rails,
sql, etc. Most of the bigger companies were more interested in a good
understanding and experience with data structures and algorithms. Prep
accordingly (my suggestion is prep both at the same time by building something)

6. **Know your dream targets and what languages they use** - for example Google's
languages are Python, Java, C++. Amazon's are Java, C++, C. So if Google
and Amazon were my two dream companies, it'd probably be smart to practice
Java or C++ over Python or C. Know your language overlaps, so you can sound
confident with your language of choice during an interview.

7. During an interview, ask what language is preferred. I have some friends
that didn't use one of the suggested languages for that company, and as a 
result didn't succeed in their interviews. Even if the interviewer lets you
use another language, unless you're phenomenally talented, I doubt it's
a good idea. Definitely a negative to use a non-companyesque language. As
an interviewer, I'd be more confident giving someone high marks if they
presented in a solution I was knowledgeable in, rather than assuming they
did a problem properly in some other language.

8. **Talk through your thoughts during interviews.** An extended period of
silence is generally a BAD THING. Even if you're confused, talk through
your confusion - it's better that the interviewer knows that you're thinking
rather than you're stuck.

9. **It's FINE to ask your interviewer questions**, especially if there is something
about the problem that you don't understand, or that you're confused about. It'd
be much better to clarify a detail and get the right answer than be confused and
spend 5 minutes going down the wrong path. Relax. Converse. Be friendly.

10. **Don't be discouraged if you have a low GPA.** I screwed up earlier on in my
college career because I didn't realize what
I wanted to do with my life. I eventually figured it out, but the bad
grades I got early on still hit my GPA pretty hard. The fact is if you
can score an interview despite your GPA, it probably means that your GPA will
have little to do with whether you get an internship/job. Don't ever go
into an interview doubtful of your skills. That will only cause nervousness
and an underrepresentation of how capable you are.

11. Lastly, if you don't get a position, or if you bomb an interview, don't fret.
*Every time you put yourself in the position of job application, it gives you
an opportunity to walk away with knowledge of how to improve yourself for
next time.*

I hope someone finds these tips helpful. If anyone wants to talk to me
more about my experiences, feel free to contact me directly, and I'll be
happy to share.
