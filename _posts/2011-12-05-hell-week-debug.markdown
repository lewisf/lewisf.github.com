{% img right images/mj.png 450 288 Contract Work %}
This week is finals week, with my first final beginning tomorrow. Unfortunately,
this week is also deploy week for our project at Social Print Studio. I spent
the whole last weekend tweaking and debugging code for our contracted project due
soon, in fact to the point that I've only begun to study for my finals. And I feel
kind of screwed. as I opened the practice finals for CSE 130, I realize
that I've pretty much forgotten ocaml.

Time to burn it into my brain.

On the otherhand, I'm excited to see the contract site go into full on production.
So excited in fact, that I can't stop myself from periodically checking server
production logs and server status, despite my really needing to study for finals
now. Hopefully I'll be okay.
