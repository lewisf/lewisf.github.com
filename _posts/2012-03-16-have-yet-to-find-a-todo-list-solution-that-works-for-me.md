Todo lists: They've been around forever - people have used them for many years to
come in order to organize their lives. The standard notepad used to be perfectly fine
for the casual homemaker who needed a list of chores that needed to be accomplished
within the day. It guaranteed that nothing important was forgotten as long as the owner
of the list remembered to examine the list on a regular basis.

Now look at today, a vastly connected world, where it seems like there are an infinite
number of things that we all want to get done in our lives. Because I'm pursuing a B.S.
in C.S, let me put this in terms relevant to me. Computer Science is a broad field, and
you could definitely spend years specializing in topics such as Machine Learning, Natural
Language Processing, Graph Theory, etc. There are in fact so many different aspects to
computer science, that it's probably impossible to learn it all - and yet I often wish
I could somehow improve my time management so I could find a time slot between
studying for university courses, and working on side projects to read a machine 
learning research paper.

**We want to grow - people naturally have a thirst for knowledge** - and the most discouraging
thing for me - is when I choose to pursue something and fail. Example: I wanted to build
a better recipe website that allowed for better collaborative recipes, but that never
happened - I never got passed the initial stages of design. I was discouraged because
I was pouring in maybe 6 hours on a weekend, and there'd be no result. No immediate value
could be seen in the work I just put in. It was discouraging to continue.

**People love numbers - especially if it's in their favor.** The obvious case being
money - because having a good amount of money means that there are no money problems
to worry about. But there are other numbers that could otherwise be meaningless that
make people feel good. A good example of this is Reddit's karma system. People are
awarded karma for getting their posts upvoted or downvoted, and people go as far
as to become 'karma whores'. When a user with a lowly 0 karma suddenly gets upvoted
hundreds of times and gains a huge amount of karma, there is a sense of 'feeling good',
because that means the post was clever, or something positive, and how good it was can
be represented by numbers.

**Games are fun - numbers are an instant sign of progress.** Most games are inherently
fun because there are numbers involved. For example, in a first person shooter, you have
your kill-to-death ratio. Say you first get the game, and your average ratio is something like
1:10. Sucks. But as you play more, your ratio starts to improve to 1:5 .. to 1:2 .. to 1:1 ...
to 2:1 ... to 10:1. Eventually you're a star. Progress, measurable by kill-to-death ratios.
For a RPG, you have a multiple level systems, stat systems, skill systems, etc all 
represented by numbers. When you can see a number change from
1 to 2 to 3 to 4 eventually to 99, you feel progress. An experience bar that moves from
0/100 to 50/100 to 90/100, you immediately feel progress. Games are addictive because
there is an immediate reward presented in the form of numbers.

So in the examples above, there is always some sort of state of success that is desired,
and some sort of long path towards it. And I propose that the addiction to each example
is that there is an instant gratification that is represented in a form that is widely
understandable by all human beings - a number count. That's what makes things addictive,
having a quantitive value of progress that could be understood in some way or another.

And in life - there's the exact same thing. We all want to be successful, we desire to
live good lives, but the path to success in our real lives versus our virtual lives is
often much more difficult. Todo lists help keep us on track, but it's too easy to become
discouraged by todo lists when they start getting cluttered with 10 or 20 todos. Eventually
we just stop looking at all the current solutions.

The goal of todo lists is ultimately to help improve **productivity** so I propose we
gamify productivity in the form of todo lists with quantitative values that represent
progress. Imagine a todo-list where you can compare your 'productivity value' in
February to your productivity value in March. Increase or decrease? I'm becoming
better at life, or what the hell happened, I need to focus more on my tasks.

Current solutions are based around the idea that we are overwhelmed when there are more
than 7 items on a todo list - and at that point we are so discouraged that we just stop
looking at the list. I want to believe that there is nothing more satisfying than
seeing a (0 completed/100 todos) number change to (75 completed/100 todos) number
hovering somewhere over my list, because it is a sign that I'm progressing, and say I
for some reason posted this todo list publically and could show all my friends, "HEY
LOOK AT HOW MUCH CRAP I GOT DONE, I'M AMAZING!", I'd selfishly feel even better about
my self because then it becomes a feat that I accomplished that everyone I care about
KNOWS I accomplished.

Anyway, todo lists need to be revamped. In a world where people are getting busier and
busier, there are definitely needs for modern productivity tools that cater to natural
human instincts and natural human behaviors. People WANT to be more productive, because
people have the natural design to do amazing things in some form or another. 
We're capable of accomplishing difficult things or an insane number of tasks as long 
as the incentive is there. And I argue that what's important about todo lists is
productivity and so we should make productivity into a game by adding some sort of
quantitative feedback.
