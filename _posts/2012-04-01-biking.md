In preparation for the next chapter of my life, I decided that it was a good time
to get into cycling - not only as an alternative cardiovascular activity to the
running I've been doing for a bit more than a year now, but also as a way to
commute to work throughout the younger years of my life.

And so, this naturally marks one of the bigger changes in my life, a new hobby, a
new sport, a new momentum to just become a better person.

Here's th bike by the way, a 1992 Trek 1000 in intense blue. Got it lightly used,
and I'm loving it. Despite it being an aluminum frame from the 80's, I did some
quick research on metal fatigue, and it appears that since this bike was used
lightly, I shouldn't have to worry about it - especially since its a Trek, and it's
supposedly well made. Here's a picture :)
