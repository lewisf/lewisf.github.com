I've spent the last quarter working on a great team with an excellent group of
student software engineers building We Have We Need. Even though it's not ready
for prime time, we had to make a presentation to demonstrate our progress. I
thought it'd be fitting to post a slide deck I put together here so that anybody
else interested could get a glimpse into what our project is about.

So here it is:
