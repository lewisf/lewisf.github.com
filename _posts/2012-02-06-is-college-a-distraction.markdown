I just want to go out into a real world and DO THINGS. I want to MAKE THINGS and MAKE AN IMPACT.
I'm sick of being told what to do and that I WILL need knowledge. I feel so confined, imprisoned.
College has really made shoving knowledge that may or may not be useful down our throats. The only
promise we have that this knowledge is relatively useful is that it *might* be handy in our future
jobs.

I really want to take a year off, or maybe forever off and go do a startup or something. But I'm
trapped. 1. My parents expect me to finish college - that's been one of their major goals in life ...
to put their kids through college. And me giving up college would be a huge blow to them. 2. What
options do I have if I don't succeed without a college degree? What happens then? For the sake
of securing an adequate future, I need to finish college.

So here's the dilemma: society as it is now expects me to finish college now that I've started,
because the DEGREE seems to mean something to a lot of people, almost to the point that the
knowledge gained along the way doesn't even matter. Heck, cheating in universities is prevalent
because a majority of the students understand that the shit they learn in class probably isn't
worth the trouble, and that just the degree, and perhaps a good GPA, will put them in the same
bracket of potential hires as someone who legitimately worked their asses off.

And then the other issue: some of us aren't good at this stuff. Some of us suck at the theoretical,
but will rock your socks off when it comes to hand on working. Most universities don't cater to that.
Sucks.

There are so many reasons why higher education is a bunch of bull shit, but I'll end my rant here.
Still looking for a solution for me to do well in university (I might as well, since I started,
and people are inclined to look at my GPA when they first hire me) and pursue something that is
more practical - like a startup or some big software engineering project. If anyone has any
suggestions on how I could get this done, I'm asking you to contact me in one way or another,
and let me know.

Thanks.
