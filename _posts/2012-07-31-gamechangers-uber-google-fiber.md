We've all heard - [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com) - a service that will force competing
internet service providers to upgrade speeds and lower costs. In a nut shell,
America, prepare yourself for faster, cheaper, and more reliable internet 
in the next decade. Many people are saying that Google hasn't proven
themselves as a reliable ISP - a market where they are relatively new, so
they probably won't be able to offer good services. I disagree completely,
Google is an internet company - and thrive on web. They're doing exactly
what they did with Google Chrome and the browsers - pushing the competition
further faster so that they can benefit from the increased user experience of
web on their core product: Search (and now I guess Youtube and Plus). They
gain nothing from just putting Google Fiber out there and not pursuing it
as hard as they can - and in the long term will gain a lot more as users
adopt quicker internet speeds and spend more time on Google Hangouts. 

I'm actually more excited about the prospect of free internet across the city.
If Fiber is as fast as they claim (it can go faster than 1.0 gbps), and
enough hotspots are set up around the city - the notion of city-wide free
wifi is not just a dream anymore - I mean Google said no to cellular data
in the Nexus 7 - I wouldn't be surprised if they'd rather push for constant
wifi connections and wifi-only tablets. No more reliance on crappy data plans and
their respective data caps from the monopolized cell phone providers (recall Google
tried to disrupt this business before but failed).

[Uber](https://www.uber.com) has spent the last year disrupting the taxi
business by offering smartphone owners a easier way to call and pay for
a cab. The one time sign up allows us to sync our credit card information,
as well as our phone number, and then call drivers (who are rated and
vetted) with a push of a button in a provided mobile app. 
Never worry about not having enough cash on hand again. Riders won't have
to worry about riding in low cost taxi cabs either - as Uber drivers at minimum
will be in a Lincoln Towncar (sidenote: I was once picked up in a BMW 5 Series,
that was a nice ride). Yes, current Uber fares are slightly pricier than
cab fares... I suspect about $7 more on average for the service, but as it's used more, prices are
sure to go down. This is great because taxis have always been notoriously
problematic. Some taxi drivers just seem to be scam artist - and some riders
just seem to be obnoxious and snotty. With Uber, and driver ratings - much of this
can be sorted out.

Oh and they deploy [ice cream trucks](http://mashable.com/2012/07/12/uber-ice-cream/) too!
Disrupting ice cream trucks! I love it.
